## Project: InternHunter

InternHunter is a CLI-centric desktop application which aids university students in applying for tech internships.
It lets users manage their own customisable collection of companies, internships, internship applications and their 
own user profile, so that they can keep track of internships that they are interested in.

It has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 35k LoC.

## Summary of contributions

* Code contributed: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=seanjyjy&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **Features and Enhancements implemented:**
  * Convert the whole mock-ui into code and link it to be functional code. (Pull request [\#100](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/100)), (Pull request [\#144](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/144)), (Pull request [\#157](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/157)), (Pull request [\#165](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/165))
    * Highlights: It has a very modern design that is very different from AB3. There were much consideration into designing and implementing the Ui to fix the 4 data types that we have. There are tabs to simulate the different screens for the different data types. Careful use of generics are required even at the Ui side. In order to allow the user to see more information regarding a particular item, an extra view section is included on the right of the Ui. As there were quite a number of commands, the Ui have to be carefully implemented to avoid any Ui bugs.
  * Switch tab (Pull request [\#104](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/104))
    * What it does: Allows the user to switch tabs to view the different data types available.
    * Highlights: This command required careful planning as we were considering how should the app "work" for the best User Experience. Ultimately, we decided that we will help to improve the User Experience by helping them to switch tabs if they were to execute commands for other tabs. Thus this command become solely for the user to just switch between the tabs without having to execute commands that might cause changes.
  * Find Applications (Pull request [\#190](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/190)), (Pull request [\#198](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/198))
    * What it does: Allows the user to find applications by Job Title from the app's application list.
  * List all applications (Pull request [\#190](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/190)), (Pull request [\#198](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/198))
    * What it does: Allows the user to list all applications in the app's application list.
