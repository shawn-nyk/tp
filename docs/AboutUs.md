title: About Us
---

AddressBook - Level 3 was developed by the [SE-EDU](https://se-education.org/docs/team.html) team. Our team was tasked
to build on top of this project to morph it to something new! We chose to build a internship hunting application,
InternHunter, to help university students like us!

We are a team based in the [School of Computing, National University of Singapore](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg).
