# About Us

AddressBook - Level 3 was developed by the se-edu team. Our team was tasked to build on top of this project to morph 
it to something new! We chose to build a internship hunting application, InternHunter,
to help university students like us!

We are a team based in the [School of Computing, National University of Singapore](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg).
